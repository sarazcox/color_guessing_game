# color_guessing_game 
Created a color guessing game and used avaScript, including functions, variables, arrays, operators, if statements, do ... while loops, and more. 
Created the game using a single HTML file with the JavaScript inside the script element, rather than an external JavaScript file.
Also added some CSS elements to it
